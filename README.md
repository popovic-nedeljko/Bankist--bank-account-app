# Bankist - bank account application

[Bankist](https://bankist-bankaccountapp.netlify.app/)

Bankist is a application that simulated a banking application.

It consists of 4 customers:

Nedeljko Popovic => user: np * pin: 1111

Jessica Davis=> user: jd * pin: 2222

Jonas Schmedtmann => user: js * pin: 3333

Sarah Smith => user: ss * pin: 4444

(With this information you can login and see the online bank interface.)

In this application, these 4 people can transfer money between each other or can get a loan. The UI will be updated immediately afterwards.

This app is a part of Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Thanks to this application, I learned most of the Array methods (map, filter,slice, flat, flatMap, findIndex, find, some, join, reduce, forEach) and how to set and configure dates, internationalizing numbers, set timers.
